 The import is there but it's not being used! Let me verify the actual data flow:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Trace actual query data flow            
     ☒ Verify what components are actually used
     ☐ Document real vs intended architecture

● ACTUAL Current Data Flow (What's Really Happening):

  1. User enters query in UI (http://localhost:3000)
  2. UI sends POST request to http://localhost:8000/query
  3. API receives request in api_with_pooling.py
  4. API calls generate_sql() which:
    - Gets database schema
    - Creates prompt with schema + hardcoded hints about sow_drops
    - Sends to Gemini-1.5-flash
    - Gemini generates SQL
  5. API executes SQL directly on Neon database
  6. Returns results to UI

  What's NOT Being Used:

  - ❌ Vanna - Not used at all (exists in ff_agent_vanna.py but not called)
  - ❌ Vector Store - Imported but never called
  - ❌ Query patterns - Stored in database but not accessed
  - ❌ Caching - No cache being used

  What Components Exist But Are Disconnected:

  1. Vanna setup (ff_agent_vanna.py) - Trained but not integrated
  2. Vector database with 69+ patterns - Created but not queried
  3. Query suggestion API (port 8002) - Running separately
  4. Monitoring dashboard (port 8001) - Running separately

  The system is currently just using Gemini directly with hardcoded hints. The vector enhancement and Vanna are
  not integrated into the actual query flow.
