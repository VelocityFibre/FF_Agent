It assumes only one project with \"Law\" in its code exists and would fail if multiple Lawley projects exist.  A more robust solution involves using a proper project ID lookup using a unique identifier rather than partial matching on project code or name.\n* **Data Consistency:**  The query uses `project_code` in `projects` and `project_name` in `status_changes`.  This inconsistency is risky and needs to be addressed.  A better approach would involve using a consistent join key across tables, possibly through a shared `project_id` column.\n* **Error Handling:** The query assumes tables have data and that joins will work as expected.  It needs enhancements to handle cases where no matching data is found in one or more of the tables.  For example, a `LEFT JOIN` is used, but specific error handling could be added to better detect and manage such issues.\n* **Data Filtering and Thresholds:** The query returns all data.  For practical use, filters based on signal strength thresholds, date ranges (e.g., last 30 days), and specific statuses (e.g., \"failed,\" \"disconnected\") should be included to focus on the most relevant drops.\n* **Performance:** For very large datasets, this query might be slow.  Adding indexes to relevant columns (especially `project_id`, `drop_number`, and date columns) would greatly improve query performance.\n\n\nThis improved query provides a much more robust and informative solution for identifying drops in the Lawley project and understanding their status and signal quality. Remember to adapt the query with specific thresholds and filters based on FibreFlow's needs.  The Firebase query was not necessary based on the query's focus.]\n(Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/20/f405)",
